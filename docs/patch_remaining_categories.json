Trains the handstand entry, overhead shoulder stability, and proprioception under load. A safer and more controllable handstand entry than kicking up from the floor. Also a useful shoulder strength exercise in its own right.",

Balance work adapts slowly; consistent daily or every-other-day practice with low fatigue is superior to infrequent high-volume sessions.",
      "cues": [
        "Kick-up: one foot steps close to hands, powerful swing of back leg overhead",

Targets anterior deltoid, triceps, and upper trapezius under full bodyweight overhead load. Demanding exercise — requires solid 30s+ wall hold and consistent full-extension overhead pressing strength as prerequisite.",
      "cues": [
        "Only attempt if freestanding handstand or 30s+ wall hold is established",
        "Lower slowly: 3-second controlled eccentric to head barely touching floor",
        "Press to complete lockout — no partial reps",
        "If elbow flare occurs: keep elbows slightly inside the wrist line (not wide flare)",
        "Stop at the first rep where lockout is incomplete — do not grind through form breakdown",

One of the highest-efficiency low-skill cardio tools: requires minimal equipment, zero gym footprint, and raises heart rate rapidly. Standard tool in climbing gym warm-ups. NOTE: pattern field flagged as vocabulary gap ('carry' is incorrect — update vocab to 'locomotion' first).",

        "Land on balls of feet, soft knees — never flat-footed",
        "5 min continuous is the baseline. If tripping frequently, shorten to 2×2 min with 1 min rest",

Trains integrated shoulder stability, hip mobility, and core rotation through the largest range of motion of any single exercise. Bechtel and Hörst both recommend TGU for climbing-specific general athleticism and shoulder resilience. 2 reps per side = very high quality work volume.",
      "cues": [
        "Start lying, arm vertical with weight directly above shoulder, eyes on the weight throughout",
        "Sequence: roll to elbow → press to hand → bridge hips up → sweep back knee → kneeling → stand",

        "2 reps/side at quality > 5 reps/side rushed. Never sacrifice the eye-on-weight rule",

Carries are recommended in Hörst and Bechtel programming as general conditioning that builds real-world climbing grip endurance and trunk stability without specific climbing movements.",
      "cues": [
        "Weight in each hand — kettlebells, dumbbells, or loaded buckets all work",

        "30s carry at chosen weight, rest 60s, repeat 3 times",
        "Load: should feel heavy in grip by 20s. If grip is not the limiter, weight is too light",

Trains anterior core stability, contralateral coordination, and shoulder stability through a full locomotion pattern. Used in Bechtel general conditioning circuits and Uphill Athlete climbing programs. NOTE: pattern field flagged as vocabulary gap ('carry' is incorrect — update vocab to 'locomotion' first).",

Targets the thoracic extension and rotation deficit common in climbers from sustained forward-flexed postures on overhanging walls. 5 minutes pre-session for optimal shoulder range.",
      "cues": [
        "Cat-cow: 10 slow cycles — fully exhale at the top of cat, fully inhale at cow",
